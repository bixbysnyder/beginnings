# New Beginnings

Hey. everyone!

Back again with some new ideas!  Been working hard on making art for the last few years, in the (long) process of building a brand
called FLAGRANTROBOT.  But, we're back to making some games in my free time.  Poking around on GitHub (I've been lurking for a while, 
love the Doom VR stuff!), been getting back into some light programming and scripting, Doom hacks, GML, C++, and a new interest in 
Python and C#.

Came back today to check out Aseprite, a (seemingly) powerful sprite editor and successfully compiled the program from source (a first
for me from a Git.).  If it doesn't have a release, i usually just walk away and find soemthing else.  Fun program, already laid down a few basic assets for a basic prototype I want to make.  Also getting interested in Phaser and Cocos2d-x.  They both look a little more in-depth than GMS2, which might be something to look into moving forward.

Anyway, as I was saying, I built Aseprite from source today, and it works well.  Oddly, the install instructions were saying to use the 
x64 skia library, but, caused an error message while compiling the program (cmake and ninja), complaining about "the target system
being wrong when building the program for x64", or something along those lines.  Either way, I downloaded the x86 package and all
was well.  I doubt a sprite editor, no matter how complex the animation or tileset, will use more than 2GB of RAM anyway (or at least I
think that's the deal).  Solid program, might have to throw the $15 at those guys, especially if they get robust tileset creation
tools added to it soon.  Speaking of, I also purchased 'Pro Motion NG' hastily.  I was getting irritated while compiling Aseprite (not
being entirely sure what I was looking at after the 3rd compile fail) and I thre my hands up and said "FUCK IT, I'M BUYING THAT OTHER 
PROGRAM!".  Now, I'm still waiting on my key and I don't even really want it.  The interface was clunky and it seemed slightly obtuse
for a pixel graphic editor.  I suppose $39 isn't a steep purchase or anything, especiallly after being part of the Adobe ecosystem for so long, but I can't shake the idea that it was ultimately a waste of money, like DesignDoll or Corel Painter.  Maybe I'll get use out
of the tileset editor, that seems pretty powerful. It's also something I've looked for in Photoshop for a while now.

I guess you could say I've gotten quite carried away with this reintroduction here, I'm just really excited to dive back into GitHub.
Hope to connect, network, and make something great with you all soon!

Stay gold,
