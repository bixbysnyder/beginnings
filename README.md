Tutorial Repo on GitHub

Hi, everyone!

I made an account here a while back to take a look at the Torque2D source code.  I forgot all about GitHub until now and want to get reacquainted with the site!

I work with professional artists in Western Massachusetts, and am trying to pursue my long-time passion to make video games.  The recent free release of UE4 brought me back to GitHub and I'm excited to get working on some projects!

With Regards,
